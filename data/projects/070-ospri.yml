description: " <p> OSPRI represents a longstanding relationship CUSD has with the Smithsonian Institution. In the past, our team has worked with closely with the National Zoo to find viable alternatives to single-use plastic water bottles they can actually implement on their premises. We also take part in the Zooâ€™s annual Earth Optimism event (more information regarding that can be found <a href='https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/04/earth-day-2019-cornell-students-teach-kids-reduce-plastic'>here</a>.) This year we are moving forward in our partnership with the Zoo, and are building zero-waste guidelines that the Zoo will utilize in event planning."
