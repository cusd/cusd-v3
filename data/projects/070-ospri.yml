description: " <p> SST represents a longstanding sustainability-focused relationship that CUSD has
maintained with the Smithsonian Institution. In the past, our work focused on assisting the
Smithsonianâ€™s National Zoo with their plastics reduction initiative. Currently, our team operates
on a flexible advisory model, addressing a range of Smithsonian sustainability initiatives. In Fall
2019, we researched and wrote a report on best practices for zero-waste events planning at
Smithsonian. During Spring 2020 we are excited to continue revising and updating this report as
well as consulting on other sustainability projects Smithsonian has underway."
