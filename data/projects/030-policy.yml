description: " <p> ICN 2030 Policy is researching existing policies, programs, and best practices in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in existing buildings with a focus on implementation in small U.S. cities. Our work builds on the Ithaca Green Building Code, which creates requirements and incentives for new buildings on sustainability. Now, our team aims to address the larger problem of existing buildings, which Ithaca has a large stock of. How can we rehabilitate old, sometimes culturally significant buildings to be more energy efficient in an equitable way? The City of Ithaca is partnering as a real-world stakeholder to implement this project's findings and serve as a role model for U.S. cities. <p> Our team is currently structured into subteams focused on Policy, Economics, and Sociology & Equity so that we can take a systems approach to the challenge of sustainable policy. We consider issues such as political feasibility, tax revenues, labor shortages, affordable housing, and gentrification in our work."
