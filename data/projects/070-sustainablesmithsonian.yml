description: " <p> SST represents a longstanding sustainability-focused relationship that 
CUSD has maintained with the Smithsonian Institution. In the past, our work focused on 
assisting the Smithsonian’s National Zoo with their plastics reduction initiative. 
Currently, our team operates on a flexible advisory model, addressing a range of 
Smithsonian sustainability initiatives. During 2019-2020 we researched and wrote a
 report on best practices for zero-waste events planning at Smithsonian. In Fall 
 2020, we developed a green certification comparison tool to help Smithsonian 
 compare and contrast opportunities and requirements for different green certification 
 programs they might pursue at various of its hundreds of buildings and facilities. 
 This project continues in Spring 2021: now we’re working on incorporating modelling 
 capabilities into this tool, and we’re also exploring other practices Smithsonian 
 could adopt tactically to improve its implementation of the array of sustainability, 
 wellness, and equity practices green certifications support nowadays."
