description:
  "<p>The project team has been tasked by the Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT) with re-envisioning an integrated bus system throughout the county. A mix of engineers, designers, architects, and planners have been designing bus shelters, revisiting bus routes and bus stop locations, and developing a real time bus information system interface, all informed by empathy fieldwork. This project is a great opportunity to apply Systems Design Thinking and quantitative analytical tools to a complex infrastructural problem, as well as incorporate cutting-edge sustainable technologies. The goal is to provide insights about the systems behavior and performance to help prioritize development efforts. Members will be empowered to design solutions for our community and work closely with TCAT and other regional stakeholders. This is a real project with full-scale prototypes and real implementations. </p>
