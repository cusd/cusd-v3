  "<p>
  Eventually, we plan to introduce this alternative waste system to the local Cornell/
  Ithaca community, where we can re-purpose plastic waste on a broader scale.

<p>
Additionally, ARC will consist of community outreach,
educating local elementary school students and the
general public about recycling.
