description:
  "<p>
In collaboration with Shoals Marine Laboratory, this project focuses on providing accessible, 
sustainable, and environmentally conscious options to the fishing industry through marine aquaculture. 
The goal of this project is to design and build an aquaculture module that can maintain multiple 
different species and withstand the turbulence of open waters. This project will rely on a combination 
of biological study of marine species and mechanical engineering principles to build a module that is 
efficient and effective.
