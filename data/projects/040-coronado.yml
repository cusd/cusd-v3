description: " <p> The nation is in desperate need of more renewable energy.  There was an idea that the National Guard could be 
hired on as full-time employees to construct renewable energy developments at National Guard bases.  This would not only provide 
National Guard employees with a lifelong trade skill but would also increase the amount of renewable energy being used in the 
Department of Defense, while also helping to mitigate one of the biggest current threats to our way of life: climate change.  
Our team of engineers has been working with contacts in the National Guard to write a proposal with the long-term goal of pushing 
our ideas through congress to make a real-world impact with full-scale implementations."
