description: " <p> Since Solar Panel Reboot is a new project this semester, we are currently in the research and planning phase. Our research involves 
how solar panels work, different ways solar panels can be damaged, how to reliably test the power output of solar panels, and potential ways of repairing 
damaged solar panels. We will use this research to create a plan of action."
