As of now we have begun collecting waste from a nearby housing 
coop and are also waiting on the arrival of 4 waste collection devices donated to us by the company Separett. We also recently 
received a grant from Engaged Cornell for 3,000$, 2,000$ went to our two partner groups, 1,000$ for GreenTree Ithaca and 1,000$ to 
the Soil Factory node in Kenya. The last 1,000$ is currently being used by us to purchase materials we plan to use to construct 
a straw-bale garden where the collected waste can be made use of. As of now the team is mostly working on getting designs for 
our Biochar system and straw-bale garden down.
