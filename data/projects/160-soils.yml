It's great to be working with you! Sorry for the late response but we were trying to figure out some answers to your questions. 
As of now we are looking to get some input from our team on the logo. Regarding testimonials we aren't sure if people will have 
much to say just yet about the project considering we are only a couple of weeks in. As for the cover photo, we aren't sure if 
we should be taking our own photo of our project or finding one online. 

We can offer some updates on stakeholders and project events however! As of now we have begun collecting waste from a nearby housing 
coop and are also waiting on the arrival of 4 waste collection devices donated to us by the company Separett. We also recently 
received a grant from Engaged Cornell for 3,000$, 2,000$ went to our two partner groups, 1,000$ for GreenTree Ithaca and 1,000$ to 
the Soil Factory node in Kenya. The last 1,000$ is currently being used by us to purchase materials we plan to use to construct 
a straw-bale garden where the collected waste can be made use of. As of now the team is mostly working on getting designs for 
our Biochar system and straw-bale garden down.
