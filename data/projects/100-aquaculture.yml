  "<p>
Aquaculture is working to identify opportunities for improvement within recirculating 
aquaculture systems, in order to design and implement solutions in partnership with 
Pacific Jade LLC., Professor Michael Timmons, Finger Lakes Fish, and Hudson Valley 
Fish Farms. The team is developing software to monitor fish feeding patterns through 
multiple avenues, and evaluating data through machine learning software. The goal of 
the project is to develop a ‘smart’ application for automatic fish feeding systems 
in order to optimize fish feeding schedules based on behavior. The product focuses 
on group monitoring, rather than individualized monitoring, and uses the concept of 
“splash factor” to determine whether fish behavior remains consistent with the data on 
a day to day and diurnal pattern basis. Fish behavior will be particularly monitored 
during feeding cycles to identify any trends in nutrient content in the water. Water 
quality parameters that will be monitored include dissolved oxygen, ammonia, electrical c
onductivity, pH, temperature and water level in the tank. 8:48 Our mission: Using 
machine learning to create more feed-efficient recirculating aquaculture systems.
