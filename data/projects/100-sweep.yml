  "<p>We’re working on this project with
Cornell Sustainability Consultants (CSC) and Rob Watson
(creator of LEED).
</p>
<p>
Set to launch in Fall 2018, this project entails collecting
and analyzing data on waste management in Ithaca, and
researching best practices for reducing waste and new
technologies to reuse waste. We’ll be focusing on conversion
technology for waste materials and conducting
an infrastructure analysis, while CSC focuses on governance.
