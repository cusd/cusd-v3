description: This project is a full-scale energy audit of Smithsonian's design museum, giving students experience with energy-based consulting and software, all for one of the East-Coast meccas of design. The team has done research on local rebate and other audit-related information required, and familiarized themselves with the tools needed to conduct the audit through dummy building models. They have been developing a scope document for the stakeholder and are working to establish a better connection with the contact at Smithsonian.
