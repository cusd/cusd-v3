lede: "Technical Operations supports all of CUSDâ€™s digital resources, both as an organization as a whole, and through each subproject."
description: "<p>In 2015, when CUSD redesigned its website, the organization found a need for a sub team with a development background to maintain its ever-expanding digital presence. In the past two years, examples of our projects include the Sustainable Education Ghana website page expansion, the construction of an internal CUSD alumni database, and custom team water bottles.</p>
<p>For Spring 2017, Technical Operations has partnered with Ithaca Welcomes Refugees, a community organization that fosters a welcoming environment for refugees who come to the region. We are working to create a website that provides historical, factual information about refugees in Ithaca and humanizes their experience. We are using digital, interactive maps to represent the trends and where different individual refugees came from and what their journeys were like. Stay tuned for the launch of the website in May.</p>"
